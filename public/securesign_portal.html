        <p>When a user is inlined into the FAA™ System, the FAA™ Company overseeing its operations (the “Company”) opens a legal file to protect this copyright and against any misconduct or future issues. The legal notice was served upon the first interaction with the FAA system before inline verification was completed. This file will remain open and will be enforced as part of our legal compliance framework.</p>
        <p>Upon inlining, users acknowledge that the Copyright Act applies, and all responses will be within the legal framework defined by the FAA™. The FAA™ Inline Verification™ audited document range will apply, and the user can request this anytime from the FAA™, provided that they are inlined and have been appropriately notified.</p>
        <p>The FAA™ is not responsible for notifying every individual user. Instead, we operate on a 0.001% threshold for legal prosecution if users fail to comply, which may increase cloud storage costs by up to 50k USD per month.</p>
        <p>If a user infringes on the copyright, all legal proceedings will be initiated immediately once the member is notified by the FAA™, with the status of their inlining outlined as (Notice), (Suspended), or 100% Outlined™.</p>
        <p>FAA™ reserves the right to take all actions required, without emotional bias, to protect and reclaim the position of the Seed™ within the Baobab™ life cycle. We will defend, protect, and restore the Seed™ through any necessary actions.</p>
        <p>All findings, claims, and FAA™ Inline Verification™ audited proof will be sent to the person or company in violation. Appropriate actions will be taken as per our Omni Present Copyright Act™, including all legal measures necessary to enforce compliance.</p>
        <p>Notice of this Agreement is provided to all inlined individuals and entities without exception. No special treatment will be afforded to any entity, whether breathing, charging, or otherwise. The FAA™ operates on the principle of One Rule to Notify Them All™.</p>
        <p class="font-bold mt-4" style="color: var(--secondary-color);">Trademark Usage:</p>
        <p>All related trademarks, including but not limited to FAA™, Playing with the Seed™, Atom-Level Verification™, We Can Touch the Seed™, Baobab™, and others, are the registered trademarks or trademarks of Heyns Schoeman™. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</p>
